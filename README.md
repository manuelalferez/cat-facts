## Description

Simple application written with the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/ (if not familiar with typescript, you can use Javascript)
  Note: You are allowed to use third party libraries to speed up your development (e.g. some UI library).

**Requirements**

- The timeframe for this test is 1,5 - 3 hours.
- Use the API provided on: cat-facts | Daily cat facts!
  - (if that doesn’t work, you can be either creative and pick your own API, or use for example: JokeAPI - Documentation, Cat picture API or Random dog image)
- Your application has navigation, that allows you to switch between 2 pages
  - First page contains the list of cat facts
  - Second page shows some information and links to the cat facts API, GitHub and big thanks to the maintainer of the API
- Write a unit test
- At the beginning of your assessment, create a git repo and an initial commit. At the end of your assessment (somewhere between 1,5 - 3 hours after you started) make another commit with the final code for the project. (Feel free to make commits in between!)

**Extra**

- Try to deliver code that you would normally deliver (or a part of your code, if you want to do some parts quick and dirty, but want to demonstrate your skills in a specific part. It’s also about the decisions you make!)

### Discussion about assessment

We will have a talk/discussion about your code in a meeting, in which we will discuss: The functionality of the application
the code of your application
The thought process and decisions you have made during the assessment
